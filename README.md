Expect more features soon!

This is an updated and revised version of the original NodeCore Nature mod,
with significant fixes, enhancements, and incorporating some new content
from the base game.

Based on [NodeCore Nature: Revised by Warr1024], which in turn is based on
the original [NodeCore Nature by Winter94](/packages/Winter94/nc_nature/)

This mod is intended as a drop-in replacement for the original Nature mod
for existing worlds.  This mod may make lasting changes to your world as
mapblocks are loaded or new content is accessed.  Make sure you
**back up your world** before upgrading.
